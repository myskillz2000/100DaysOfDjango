# 100DaysOfDjango

# Day 1
Just a basic polling app.  This app accepts input from the user and saves it to the database.  It will also show dynamically when added from the form.  This is by no means production ready.  In a later day we will look into making application production ready.  This is just an easy project to get started with django.
